									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/droid2299/Creatives" class="image fit"><img src="images/creatives.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>An android app where creative minded people can showcase their talents and passions in a free and open environment. The app was created using Java and the Firebase was used as the server. The app features sing in\up , login and forgot password capabilites. The users can also upload images, videos, texts and audio files which will be displayed in thier own profile page as well as on categorized pages. A system generated email will be sent to the user when he wished to change the password. </p>

									<a href="generic.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/cosmos3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Cosmos is a ML project which classifies images of galaxies based on the Hubble Classification. At the heart of the project is a Convolutional Neural Network which was able to achieve an accuracy of around 93%. The dataset was obtained from the Galaxy Zoo challenge from Kaggle and from the NASA hubble website and images were augment according to our needs. An implementation paper was published on the same.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/droid2299/Distortion" class="image fit"><img src="images/distortion.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Distortion is web app created by me completely from scratch which can be used to stream music. It has features such as
										<ul>
											<li style="text-align:left">Lets users signup and login</li>
											<li style="text-align:left">Create and edit playlists</li>
											<li style="text-align:left">Listen to music according to genre</li>
											<li style="text-align:left">Search the site on the basis of song name, artist name and album name.</li>
											<li style="text-align:left">View user information and edit it.</li>
											<li style="text-align:left">Adjust music controls such as volume, skip to next track, repeat a song, previous song etc.</li>

										</ul>
									MySQL was used as the DB and extra care was taken to ensure that the normalization techniques were enforced while making the RDBMS.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/apollo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Apollo is an on going project which is basically a music generation system which uses General Adversarial Networks. This is my capstone project for my undergrad and should be complete by April 2021. A survey paper is under review in Engineering Application of Artifical Intelligence.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/droid2299/Neural-Style-Transfer">Neural Style Transfer<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/droid2299/Neural-Style-Transfer" class="image fit"><img src="images/nst.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image. This idea was proposed by Leon A. Gatys and we will be implenting this paper using the TensorFlow Library using python</p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/droid2299/Manager" class="image fit"><img src="images/manager.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Manager was one my first android project which implemented the FirstFit, BestFit and WorstFit algorithms of memory management statically. It was part of my coursework in OS in sem 4 of my undergrad. Its just a simple app with an easy to use interface.</p>
